function [window] = PixxPut(window,PutVal,CLUT,BiosemiCableInUse)
%[window] = PIXXPUT(window,PutVal[,CLUT][,BiosemiCableInUse]) Puts a trigger to the ViewPixx
%   Calculates the color that should be drawn on the top left pixel of the
%   ViewPixx \EEG display, in order to trigger a value PUTVAL to the EEG
%   recording.
%   NOTE: LEAVE THE MS-WINDOWS DESKTOP-BACKGROUND BLACK! This way, the trigger that's
%   sent once PTB closes is always 0.
%   NOTE2: This function only draws on the buffer. The actual trigger is not
%   sent until you subsequently flip the screen and it is triggered for as
%   long as this screen is presented. (You'd need to re-flip, to null it)

%   INPUT:
%   window            = PTB-window-pointer
%   PutVal            = 0-255, the triggervalue you want to send
%   CLUT              = 256x3 Matrix with CLUT values of 0-1; if present,
%                       the calculated RGB-values are recalculated to match
%                       the CLUT.
%   BiosemiCableInUse = The optional argument BIOSEMICABLEINUSE can be set to 1 (default), if
%                       the Biosemi Presentation cable or the AE Busch specialized cable is
%                       used. This db25->db37 adapter has pins 2-9 on the db25 side soldered to
%                       pins 1-8 on the db37 side, set to 1 to take care of that (default).
